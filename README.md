## ✧ Problem
- A client has required from us to create a solution where he can have an application that can perform basic calculations and convert specific types of currencies. 

## ✧ Solution
- The simplist solution is to create a website with a calculator and a currency converter, the idea was to design the website to work in a smarphone screen.

## ✧ User journey
- Once the user opens the website he is greeted with a welcome.
- there are two buttons one labeled calculator and another labeled currency converter, each button opens their respective applications.
- once the user opens the calculator an opaque calculator, in it he can click on the numbers and operators to perform the calculations he wants.
- If the user wants to convert the currency from Shekel to US dollar he can open the currency converter.
- In the currency converter the user will see two input feilds on can take a number value and the other will output the converted amount.
- Below the inputs there are two drop-down menus where the user can choose the currency he wants to input and the currency to output.
